# Gobro

It stands for "Go" and "Slowbrow", which is a lovely pokemon -- but quite lazy. Since I am lazy too when it comes to making a budget, Gobro, I choose you!

## Commands

### Simple status

go run gobro.go
```

### Importing a file into database
```sh
go run gobro.go import -f <path to the file>
```
